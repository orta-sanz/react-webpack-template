# React - Webpack GitHub template

## Techs

- React 18
- Webpack 5
- Emotion
- Typescript

## How to

-   First use `yarn install`. If you don't want to use yarn you can remove the `yarn.lock` file and then use `npm install`
-   `yarn start` will watch files and start a local dev server
-   `yarn build`. The name says it all :)
-   `yarn test` for Jest to start.
    -   `yarn test --watch` to start watching file changes
    -   `yarn test --coverage` if you want to generate a coverage report. This report will be saved inside `.reports` folder.
